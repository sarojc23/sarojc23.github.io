I have joined the Ph.D. program in Physics at The Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY). This marks my first time stepping out of my home country, Nepal, and into the vibrant, dynamic city of New York. Standing in front of the campus—right next to the iconic Empire State Building—fills me with great energy and optimism.

After completing my first year of coursework and research rotations, I’m thrilled to share that I’ve joined the **Grosso Lab**, led by Professor **Gabriele Grosso**, at the **CUNY Advanced Science Research Center** (ASRC). Our group is part of the **Photonics Initiative**, where we explore the optical properties of **two-dimensional (2D) materials** for applications in **quantum information processing** and **optoelectronic devices**.

The lab is at the forefront of pioneering research in light–matter interactions at the nanoscale. We aim to harness the extraordinary properties of 2D materials to develop next-generation technologies. I'm excited to contribute to this journey and deepen our understanding of quantum materials.
