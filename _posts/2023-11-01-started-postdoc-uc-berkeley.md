On **November 1, 2024**, I began my postdoctoral position in the **Physics Department at the University of California, Berkeley**. I have joined the **Kolkowitz Lab**, led by Professor **Shimon Kolkowitz**, where we are advancing the frontiers of **quantum sensing and metrology** using **nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond**.

My research focuses on developing a **scalable, high-resolution quantum sensing platform** by combining advanced imaging techniques, spatial light modulators (SLMs), and multiplexed optical readout of hundreds of NV centers in parallel. The goal is to probe **magnetic field fluctuations**, **correlated spin dynamics**, and **quantum noise** in novel materials and engineered systems.

This work lies at the intersection of **quantum optics**, **condensed matter physics**, and **quantum information science**, and builds upon the experimental techniques I developed during my Ph.D. in 2D quantum materials.

I'm excited to be part of such a vibrant and collaborative research environment here at Berkeley, and look forward to the discoveries ahead.
