Iâ€™m a physicist and postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, where I work on quantum sensing using NV centers in diamond. My research lies at the intersection of quantum information science, condensed matter systems, and advanced imaging.

### ðŸ§  Research Areas
- Quantum Sensing with NV Centers
- Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR)
- Spin Dynamics & Pulse Control (XY8, Ramsey, Bootstrap tomography)
- Quantum Materials (TMDs, Excitons, Spinâ€“Phonon Coupling)
- Data-Driven Scientific Discovery

### ðŸ›  Technical Skills
- Experimental Quantum Optics
- Python, LabVIEW, MATLAB, HPC, VASP, COMSOL
- SLM/AOD Integration, Drift Tracking
- Spin Control Sequences and Signal Analysis

### ðŸš€ Entrepreneurial Work
Founder @ Nepalaya Gateway Pvt. Ltd. â€” Bridging science, AI, and sustainable innovation in the Global South.

I aim to push the limits of precision metrology and quantum-enabled diagnostics with an eye toward real-world applications.
