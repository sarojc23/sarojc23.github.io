Iâ€™m a physicist and postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, where I work on quantum sensing using NV centers in diamond. My research lies at the intersection of quantum information science, condensed matter systems, and advanced imaging.

### Research Areas
- Quantum Sensing with NV Centers
- Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR)
- Spin Dynamics & Pulse Control (XY8, Ramsey, Tomography)
- Quantum Materials (TMDs, Excitons, Polarons, Phonons, )
- Data-Driven Scientific Discovery

### Technical Skills
- Experimental Quantum Optics
- Python, MATLAB, HPC, VASP
- SLM/AOD Integration, Drift Tracking
- Spin Control Sequences and Signal Analysis
