I develop precision quantum sensing tools using NV centers in diamond to explore complex many-body systems and enhance measurement technologies. My research bridges quantum control, condensed matter physics, and computational analysis to push the frontiers of imaging, computing, and materials science.

I'm driven by a vision of building scalable quantum platforms that connect experimental insights with real-world impact, especially in emerging technologies and biomedical diagnostics.
