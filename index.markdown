I develop precision quantum sensing tools using NV centers in diamond to explore complex many-body systems and enhance measurement technologies. My research bridges quantum control, condensed matter physics, and computational analysis to push the frontiers of imaging, computing, and materials science.

I'm driven by a vision of building scalable quantum platforms that connect experimental insights with real-world impact, especially in emerging technologies and biomedical diagnostics.

## Beyond Research

Outside the lab, I enjoy everything from cerebral games like chess to physical sports and gym workouts. I often find inspiration in exploring ideas at the intersection of science and entrepreneurship. I’m also fascinated by the philosophical and political dimensions of human experience and science — how discoveries shape societies, and how societal forces in turn influence scientific progress.
