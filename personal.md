### Beyond Research

Outside the lab, I enjoy everything from cerebral games like chess to physical activities like soccer and gym workouts. I often find inspiration at the intersection of science and entrepreneurship.

Here, I share insights from my entrepreneurial journey—the challenges of early-stage funding, the thrill of creating something new, and the lessons learned along the way.
