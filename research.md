My research lies at the intersection of **Condensed Matter Physics**, **Quantum Optics**, and **Quantum Information Science**. I develop and apply cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe and control **strongly correlated quantum systems**, with a particular focus on **nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond** and **two-dimensional semiconductors**.

I am especially interested in **leveraging spatial and temporal correlations** among individual quantum defects to uncover emergent dynamics in complex many-body systems. By bridging theoretical models with high-precision experiments, my work aims to explore and manipulate phenomena such as:

- Quantum coherence and decoherence
- Spin–phonon interactions
- Collective spin dynamics and metrology
- Quasiparticles (exciton, phonon, polaron, polaritons, etc.) in 2D materials

This research advances both the **fundamental understanding of quantum matter** and the development of **practical quantum technologies**, including scalable sensing, imaging, and hybrid quantum systems.

Through **interdisciplinary collaboration** and **innovation at the interface of physics and engineering**, I strive to push the boundaries of what is measurable, controllable, and ultimately useful in quantum science.

### Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond

My current project focuses on the spatial multiplexing of single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center measurements. NV centers are atom-scale defects in diamond known for their ability to sense magnetic and electric fields with exceptional sensitivity and nanoscale spatial resolution.

Inspired by optical tweezer array techniques from the neutral atom community, we aim to realize **simultaneous measurements of multiple NV centers**. This represents a significant step toward **parallel correlation measurements**, opening the door for **scalable covariance magnetometry**. Ultimately, we plan to apply this technique to explore quantum and condensed matter systems with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.

### Two-dimensional (2D) Quantum Materials

In my PhD work, I studied the **electronic and optical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials**, such as monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g., WS₂, MoSe₂) and their heterostructures. These low-dimensional systems exhibit unique behaviors due to **quantum confinement, enhanced environmental sensitivity**, and **strong many-body effects**.

Using advanced optical spectroscopy techniques, I investigated **exciton dynamics and transport**, and demonstrated tunability through **electrostatic gating**, **strain**, and **layer stacking**. My findings contributed to our understanding of **light–matter interactions** in 2D materials and their applications in **photonics**, **valleytronics**, and **quantum optoelectronics**.

### Future Directions

Looking ahead, I plan to continue advancing both of my core research directions — **solid-state quantum sensing using NV centers** and **optical control of nanoscale materials** — while integrating them in new and exciting ways. A major part of this vision involves exploring **novel quantum defects and platforms** that bring together the strengths of both fields.

In particular, I am interested in emerging systems such as:

- **Boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)**
- **Divacancies in silicon carbide (SiC)**

These defects offer robust spin properties, long coherence times, and compatibility with scalable photonic architectures. They open up promising opportunities to study **spin–phonon coupling**, **quantum coherence**, and **many-body correlated dynamics** in previously inaccessible material systems.

My long-term goal is to leverage these platforms to develop **next-generation quantum sensors and measurement protocols**, and to create **interdisciplinary testbeds** for exploring quantum phenomena at the intersection of condensed matter, quantum optics, and quantum information science.
