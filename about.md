I’m a Nepali quantum physicist and postdoctoral researcher at **UC Berkeley**, working at the intersection of **quantum sensing**, **condensed matter physics**, and **advanced optical imaging techniques**. My current research focuses on utilizing **nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond** to develop scalable, high-resolution platforms for **parallel quantum sensing and control**.

I earned my Ph.D. in Physics from the **Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC)** at the **City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center**, where I investigated **exciton–phonon interactions** and **quantum control in two-dimensional (2D) materials**. Before that, I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Physics at **Tribhuvan University** in Kathmandu, Nepal.

Originally from the mountainous district of **Baitadi, Nepal**, I’m deeply passionate about advancing the frontiers of quantum technology while fostering **international collaboration and scientific exchange**.
