I’m a Nepali quantum physicist and postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, working at the intersection of quantum sensing, condensed matter physics, and advanced imaging techniques. My currernt research focuses on using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to develop scalable, high-resolution quantum sensing platforms.

I completed my Ph.D. in Physics at Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC) of the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (CUNY), where I explored exciton-phonon interactions and quantum control in 2D materials. Prior to that, I earned my B.Sc and M.Sc. in Physics from Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, Nepal.

Born and raised in the mountainous district of Baitadi, Nepal, I’m passionate about pushing the boundaries of quantum technology while fostering global scientific collaboration.
