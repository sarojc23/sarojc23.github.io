## Research

My research lies at the intersection of **Condensed Matter Physics**, **Quantum Optics**, and **Quantum Information Science**. I develop and apply cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe and control **strongly correlated quantum systems**, with a particular focus on **nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond** and **two-dimensional semiconductors**.

I am especially interested in **leveraging spatial and temporal correlations** among individual quantum defects to uncover emergent dynamics in complex many-body systems. By bridging theoretical models with high-precision experiments, my work aims to explore and manipulate phenomena such as:

- Quantum coherence and decoherence
- Spin–phonon interactions
- Collective spin dynamics and metrology
- Quasiparticles (exciton, phonon, polaron, polaritons, etc.) in 2D materials

This research advances both the **fundamental understanding of quantum matter** and the development of **practical quantum technologies**, including scalable sensing, imaging, and hybrid quantum systems.

Through **interdisciplinary collaboration** and **innovation at the interface of physics and engineering**, I strive to push the boundaries of what is measurable, controllable, and ultimately useful in quantum science.
