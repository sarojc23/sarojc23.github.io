## Welcome!

Thank you for visiting my page. I'm **Saroj B Chand**, a Postdoctoral Scholar at the **University of California, Berkeley**, working at the intersection of quantum sensing, condensed matter physics, and advanced imaging.

I develop **precision multiplexed quantum sensing tools** using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to investigate complex many-body systems and advance next-generation measurement technologies. My research bridges **quantum control**, **condensed matter physics**, and **computational analysis** to push the frontiers of quantum imaging, computing, and materials science. I am driven by the vision of building **scalable quantum platforms** that integrate fundamental experiments with real-world applicationsâ€”especially in emerging technologies in quantum science.
